Managing The Site

* To open site:
    * Edit index-open.html as directed below
    * Rename index.html to index-closed.html, and rename index-open.html to index.html 
* To close site: 
    * Edit index-closed.html to reflect current year
    * Rename index.html to index-open.html, and rename index-closed.html to index.html 

The site automatically loads index.html when you visit

You can edit everything in the UI here on github.com, or you can use tools like Visual Studio Code. 

Editing index-open.html for a new season:
* Update flyer.pdf to reflect current items/pricing
* Edit index-open.html to reflect the upcoming sales season
* Change year in heading and any other locations as appropriate
* Update buttons as appropriate.  This has been reworked so that we are using hosted buttons.  The pricing changes can be made in PayPal.

* Once completed, save changes, commit and you are good to go.
